# World Simulation Engine

> A modular, extensible simulation engine for modeling complex socio-economic systems and entity interactions.

This project is an engineering study on **Object-Oriented Design**, **System Architecture**, and **Clean Code**. 
The goal is to build a simulation engine capable of evolving a persistent world with population, economy, and dynamic events, focusing on backend logic.
